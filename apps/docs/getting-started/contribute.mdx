# Contributing to Task Master

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Task Master! We're excited to work with you and appreciate your help in making this project better. 🚀

## 🤝 Our Collaborative Approach

We're a **PR-friendly team** that values collaboration:

- ✅ **We review PRs quickly** - Usually within hours, not days
- ✅ **We're super reactive** - Expect fast feedback and engagement
- ✅ **We sometimes take over PRs** - If your contribution is valuable but needs cleanup, we might jump in to help finish it
- ✅ **We're open to all contributions** - From bug fixes to major features

**We don't mind AI-generated code**, but we do expect you to:

- ✅ **Review and understand** what the AI generated
- ✅ **Test the code thoroughly** before submitting
- ✅ **Ensure it's well-written** and follows our patterns
- ❌ **Don't submit "AI slop"** - untested, unreviewed AI output

> **Why this matters**: We spend significant time reviewing PRs. Help us help you by submitting quality contributions that save everyone time!

## 🚀 Quick Start for Contributors

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/claude-task-master.git
cd claude-task-master
npm install
```

### 2. Create a Feature Branch

**Important**: Always target the `next` branch, not `main`:

```bash
git checkout next
git pull origin next
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 3. Make Your Changes

Follow our development guidelines below.

### 4. Test Everything Yourself

**Before submitting your PR**, ensure:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Check formatting
npm run format-check

# Fix formatting if needed
npm run format
```

### 5. Create a Changeset

**Required for most changes**:

```bash
npm run changeset
```

See the [Changeset Guidelines](#changeset-guidelines) below for details.

### 6. Submit Your PR

- Target the `next` branch
- Write a clear description
- Reference any related issues

## 📋 Development Guidelines

### Branch Strategy

- **`main`**: Production-ready code
- **`next`**: Development branch - **target this for PRs**
- **Feature branches**: `feature/description` or `fix/description`

### Code Quality Standards

1. **Write tests** for new functionality
2. **Follow existing patterns** in the codebase
3. **Add JSDoc comments** for functions
4. **Keep functions focused** and single-purpose

### Testing Requirements

Your PR **must pass all CI checks**:

- ✅ **Unit tests**: `npm test`
- ✅ **Format check**: `npm run format-check`

**Test your changes locally first** - this saves review time and shows you care about quality.

## 📦 Changeset Guidelines

We use [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage versioning and generate changelogs.

### When to Create a Changeset

**Always create a changeset for**:

- ✅ New features
- ✅ Bug fixes
- ✅ Breaking changes
- ✅ Performance improvements
- ✅ User-facing documentation updates
- ✅ Dependency updates that affect functionality

**Skip changesets for**:

- ❌ Internal documentation only
- ❌ Test-only changes
- ❌ Code formatting/linting
- ❌ Development tooling that doesn't affect users

### How to Create a Changeset

1. **After making your changes**:

   ```bash
   npm run changeset
   ```

2. **Choose the bump type**:

   - **Major**: Breaking changes
   - **Minor**: New features
   - **Patch**: Bug fixes, docs, performance improvements

3. **Write a clear summary**:

   ```
   Add support for custom AI models in MCP configuration
   ```

4. **Commit the changeset file** with your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .changeset/*.md
   git commit -m "feat: add custom AI model support"
   ```

### Changeset vs Git Commit Messages

- **Changeset summary**: User-facing, goes in CHANGELOG.md
- **Git commit**: Developer-facing, explains the technical change

Example:

```bash
# Changeset summary (user-facing)
"Add support for custom Ollama models"

# Git commit message (developer-facing)
"feat(models): implement custom Ollama model validation

- Add model validation for custom Ollama endpoints
- Update configuration schema to support custom models
- Add tests for new validation logic"
```

## 🔧 Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

### Environment Setup

1. **Copy environment template**:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Add your API keys** (for testing AI features):
   ```bash
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
   # Add others as needed
   ```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e
```

### Code Formatting

We use Prettier for consistent formatting:

```bash
# Check formatting
npm run format-check

# Fix formatting
npm run format
```
