## Task Fields in tasks.json

Tasks in tasks.json have the following structure:

| Field          | Description                                    | Example                                                |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `id`           | Unique identifier for the task.                | `1`                                                    |
| `title`        | Brief, descriptive title.                      | `"Initialize Repo"`                                    |
| `description`  | What the task involves.                        | `"Create a new repository, set up initial structure."` |
| `status`       | Current state.                                 | `"pending"`, `"done"`, `"deferred"`                    |
| `dependencies` | Prerequisite task IDs. ‚úÖ Completed, ‚è±Ô∏è Pending | `[1, 2]`                                               |
| `priority`     | Task importance.                               | `"high"`, `"medium"`, `"low"`                          |
| `details`      | Implementation instructions.                   | `"Use GitHub client ID/secret, handle callback..."`    |
| `testStrategy` | How to verify success.                         | `"Deploy and confirm 'Hello World' response."`         |
| `subtasks`     | Nested subtasks related to the main task.      | `[{"id": 1, "title": "Configure OAuth", ...}]`         |

## Task File Format

Individual task files follow this format:

```
# Task ID: <id>
# Title: <title>
# Status: <status>
# Dependencies: <comma-separated list of dependency IDs>
# Priority: <priority>
# Description: <brief description>
# Details:
<detailed implementation notes>

# Test Strategy:
<verification approach>
```

## Features in Detail

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Analyzing Task Complexity">
The `analyze-complexity` command:

- Analyzes each task using AI to assess its complexity on a scale of 1-10
- Recommends optimal number of subtasks based on configured DEFAULT_SUBTASKS
- Generates tailored prompts for expanding each task
- Creates a comprehensive JSON report with ready-to-use commands
- Saves the report to scripts/task-complexity-report.json by default

The generated report contains:

- Complexity analysis for each task (scored 1-10)
- Recommended number of subtasks based on complexity
- AI-generated expansion prompts customized for each task
- Ready-to-run expansion commands directly within each task analysis
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Viewing Complexity Report">
The `complexity-report` command:

- Displays a formatted, easy-to-read version of the complexity analysis report
- Shows tasks organized by complexity score (highest to lowest)
- Provides complexity distribution statistics (low, medium, high)
- Highlights tasks recommended for expansion based on threshold score
- Includes ready-to-use expansion commands for each complex task
- If no report exists, offers to generate one on the spot
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Smart Task Expansion">
The `expand` command automatically checks for and uses the complexity report:

When a complexity report exists:

- Tasks are automatically expanded using the recommended subtask count and prompts
- When expanding all tasks, they're processed in order of complexity (highest first)
- Research-backed generation is preserved from the complexity analysis
- You can still override recommendations with explicit command-line options

Example workflow:

```bash
# Generate the complexity analysis report with research capabilities
task-master analyze-complexity --research

# Review the report in a readable format
task-master complexity-report

# Expand tasks using the optimized recommendations
task-master expand --id=8
# or expand all tasks
task-master expand --all
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Finding the Next Task">
The `next` command:

- Identifies tasks that are pending/in-progress and have all dependencies satisfied
- Prioritizes tasks by priority level, dependency count, and task ID
- Displays comprehensive information about the selected task:
  - Basic task details (ID, title, priority, dependencies)
  - Implementation details
  - Subtasks (if they exist)
- Provides contextual suggested actions:
  - Command to mark the task as in-progress
  - Command to mark the task as done
  - Commands for working with subtasks
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Viewing Specific Task Details">
The `show` command:

- Displays comprehensive details about a specific task or subtask
- Shows task status, priority, dependencies, and detailed implementation notes
- For parent tasks, displays all subtasks and their status
- For subtasks, shows parent task relationship
- Provides contextual action suggestions based on the task's state
- Works with both regular tasks and subtasks (using the format taskId.subtaskId)
</Accordion>
