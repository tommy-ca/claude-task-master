## Setting up Cursor AI Integration

<Check>
  Task Master is designed to work seamlessly with [Cursor AI](https://www.cursor.so/), providing a structured workflow for AI-driven development.

  <Accordion title="Using Cursor with MCP (Recommended)" icon="sparkles">
    If you've already set up Task Master with MCP in Cursor, the integration is automatic. You can simply use natural language to interact with Task Master:

    ```
    What tasks are available to work on next?
    Can you analyze the complexity of our tasks?
    I'd like to implement task 4. What does it involve?
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Manual Cursor Setup">
    If you're not using MCP, you can still set up Cursor integration:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="After initializing your project, open it in Cursor">
        The `.cursor/rules/dev_workflow.mdc` file is automatically loaded by Cursor, providing the AI with knowledge about the task management system
      </Step>
      <Step title="Place your PRD document in the scripts/ directory (e.g., scripts/prd.txt)">
        
      </Step>
      <Step title="Open Cursor's AI chat and switch to Agent mode">
        
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Alternative MCP Setup in Cursor">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Go to Cursor settings">
        
      </Step>
      <Step title="Navigate to the MCP section">
        
      </Step>
      <Step title="Click on 'Add New MCP Server'">
        
      </Step>
      <Step title="Configure with the following details:">
        - Name: "Task Master"
        - Type: "Command"
        - Command: "npx -y task-master-ai"
      </Step>
      <Step title="Save Settings">
        
      </Step>
    </Steps>
    Once configured, you can interact with Task Master's task management commands directly through Cursor's interface, providing a more integrated experience.

## Initial Task Generation

In Cursor's AI chat, instruct the agent to generate tasks from your PRD:

```
Please use the task-master parse-prd command to generate tasks from my PRD. The PRD is located at scripts/prd.txt.
```

The agent will execute:

```bash
task-master parse-prd scripts/prd.txt
```

This will:

- Parse your PRD document
- Generate a structured `tasks.json` file with tasks, dependencies, priorities, and test strategies
- The agent will understand this process due to the Cursor rules

### Generate Individual Task Files

Next, ask the agent to generate individual task files:

```
Please generate individual task files from tasks.json
```

The agent will execute:

```bash
task-master generate
```

This creates individual task files in the `tasks/` directory (e.g., `task_001.txt`, `task_002.txt`), making it easier to reference specific tasks.
