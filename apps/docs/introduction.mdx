<Tip>
Welcome to v1 of the Task Master Docs. Expect weekly updates as we expand and refine each section.
</Tip>

We've organized the docs into three sections depending on your experience level and goals:

### Getting Started - Jump in to [Quick Start](/docs/getting-started/quick-start)
Designed for first-time users. Get set up, create your first PRD, and run your first task.

### Best Practices
Covers common workflows, strategic usage of commands, model configuration tips, and real-world usage patterns. Recommended for active users.

### Technical Capabilities
A detailed glossary of every root command and available capability â€” meant for power users and contributors.
