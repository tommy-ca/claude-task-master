### Minor Changes

- [#1220](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master/pull/1220) [`4e12643`](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master/commit/4e126430a092fb54afb035514fb3d46115714f97) Thanks [@Crunchyman-ralph](https://github.com/Crunchyman-ralph)! - No longer need --package=task-master-ai in mcp server
  - A lot of users were having issues with Taskmaster and usually a simple fix was to remove --package from your mcp.json
  - we now bundle our whole package, so we no longer need the --package

- [#1200](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master/pull/1200) [`fce8414`](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master/commit/fce841490a9ebbf1801a42dd8a29397379cf1142) Thanks [@eyaltoledano](https://github.com/eyaltoledano)! - Add new `task-master start` command for automated task execution with Claude Code
  - You can now start working on tasks directly by running `task-master start <task-id>` which will automatically launch Claude Code with a comprehensive prompt containing all task details, implementation guidelines, and context.
  - `task-master start` will automatically detect next-task when no ID is provided.

- [#1200](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master/pull/1200) [`fce8414`](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master/commit/fce841490a9ebbf1801a42dd8a29397379cf1142) Thanks [@eyaltoledano](https://github.com/eyaltoledano)! - Add grok-cli as a provider with full codebase context support. You can now use Grok models (grok-2, grok-3, grok-4, etc.) with Task Master for AI operations that have access to your entire codebase context, enabling more informed task generation and PRD parsing.

  ## Setup Instructions
  1. **Get your Grok API key** from [console.x.ai](https://console.x.ai)
  2. **Set the environment variable**:
     ```bash
     export GROK_CLI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
     ```
  3. **Configure Task Master to use Grok**:
     ```bash
     task-master models --set-main grok-beta
     # or
     task-master models --set-research grok-beta
     # or
     task-master models --set-fallback grok-beta
     ```

  ## Key Features
  - **Full codebase context**: Grok models can analyze your entire project when generating tasks or parsing PRDs
  - **xAI model access**: Support for latest Grok models (grok-2, grok-3, grok-4, etc.)
  - **Code-aware task generation**: Create more accurate and contextual tasks based on your actual codebase
  - **Intelligent PRD parsing**: Parse requirements with understanding of your existing code structure

  ## Available Models
  - `grok-beta` - Latest Grok model with codebase context
  - `grok-vision-beta` - Grok with vision capabilities and codebase context

  The Grok CLI provider integrates with xAI's Grok models via grok-cli and can also use the local Grok CLI configuration file (`~/.grok/user-settings.json`) if available.

  ## Credits

  Built using the [grok-cli](https://github.com/superagent-ai/grok-cli) by Superagent AI for seamless integration with xAI's Grok models.

  This feature enables moving tasks between different tags (contexts) in your project, making it easier to organize work across different branches, environments, or project phases.

  ## CLI Usage Examples

  Move a single task from one tag to another:

  ```bash
  # Move task 5 from backlog tag to in-progress tag
  task-master move --from=5 --from-tag=backlog --to-tag=feature-1

  # Move task with its dependencies
  task-master move --from=5 --from-tag=backlog --to-tag=feature-2 --with-dependencies

  # Move task without checking dependencies
  task-master move --from=5 --from-tag=backlog --to-tag=bug-3 --ignore-dependencies
  ```

  Move multiple tasks at once:

  ```bash
  # Move multiple tasks between tags
  task-master move --from=5,6,7 --from-tag=backlog --to-tag=bug-4 --with-dependencies

  The command was failing with "projectRoot is not defined" error because the code was directly referencing `projectRoot` instead of `context.projectRoot` in the git repository checks. This fix corrects the variable references to use the proper context object.

  ## New Claude Code Agents

  Added specialized agents for Claude Code users to enable parallel task execution, intelligent task orchestration, and quality assurance:

  ### task-orchestrator

  Coordinates and manages the execution of Task Master tasks with intelligent dependency analysis:
  - Analyzes task dependencies to identify parallelizable work
  - Deploys multiple task-executor agents for concurrent execution
  - Monitors task completion and updates the dependency graph
  - Automatically identifies and starts newly unblocked tasks

  ### task-executor

  Handles the actual implementation of individual tasks:
  - Executes specific tasks identified by the orchestrator
  - Works on concrete implementation rather than planning
  - Updates task status and logs progress
  - Can work in parallel with other executors on independent tasks

  ### task-checker

  Verifies that completed tasks meet their specifications:
  - Reviews tasks marked as 'review' status
  - Validates implementation against requirements
  - Runs tests and checks for best practices
  - Ensures quality before marking tasks as 'done'

  ## Installation

  When using the Claude profile (`task-master rules add claude`), the agents are automatically installed to `.claude/agents/` directory.

  ## Usage Example

  ```bash
  # In Claude Code, after initializing a project with tasks:

  # Use task-orchestrator to analyze and coordinate work
  # The orchestrator will:
  # 1. Check task dependencies
  # 2. Identify tasks that can run in parallel
  # 3. Deploy executors for available work
  # 4. Monitor progress and deploy new executors as tasks complete

  # Use task-executor for specific task implementation
  # When the orchestrator identifies task 2.3 needs work:
  # The executor will implement that specific task
  ```

  ## Benefits
  - **Parallel Execution**: Multiple independent tasks can be worked on simultaneously
  - **Intelligent Scheduling**: Orchestrator understands dependencies and optimizes execution order
  - **Separation of Concerns**: Planning (orchestrator) is separated from execution (executor)
  - **Progress Tracking**: Real-time updates as tasks are completed
  - **Automatic Progression**: As tasks complete, newly unblocked tasks are automatically started

  This release introduces two powerful new commands that allow you to dynamically adjust the complexity of your tasks and subtasks without recreating them from scratch.

  **New CLI Commands:**
  - `task-master scope-up` - Increase task complexity (add more detail, requirements, or implementation steps)
  - `task-master scope-down` - Decrease task complexity (simplify, remove unnecessary details, or streamline)

  **Key Features:**
  - **Multiple tasks**: Support comma-separated IDs to adjust multiple tasks at once (`--id=5,7,12`)
  - **Strength levels**: Choose adjustment intensity with `--strength=light|regular|heavy` (defaults to regular)
  - **Custom prompts**: Use `--prompt` flag to specify exactly how you want tasks adjusted
  - **MCP integration**: Available as `scope_up_task` and `scope_down_task` tools in Cursor and other MCP environments
  - **Smart context**: AI considers your project context and task dependencies when making adjustments

  **Usage Examples:**

  ```bash
  # Make a task more detailed
  task-master scope-up --id=5

  # Simplify multiple tasks with light touch
  task-master scope-down --id=10,11,12 --strength=light

  # Custom adjustment with specific instructions
  task-master scope-up --id=7 --prompt="Add more error handling and edge cases"
  ```

  **Why use this?**
  - **Iterative refinement**: Adjust task complexity as your understanding evolves
  - **Project phase adaptation**: Scale tasks up for implementation, down for planning
  - **Team coordination**: Adjust complexity based on team member experience levels
  - **Milestone alignment**: Fine-tune tasks to match project phase requirements

  Perfect for agile workflows where task requirements change as you learn more about the problem space.

  - **Frontmatter Transformation**: Kiro rules use simplified `inclusion: always` format instead of Cursor's complex frontmatter
  - **Special Rule**: Added `taskmaster_hooks_workflow.md` that guides AI assistants to prefer hook-driven completion

  Key hooks included:
  - Task Dependency Auto-Progression: Automatically starts tasks when dependencies complete
  - Code Change Task Tracker: Updates task progress as you save files
  - Test Success Task Completer: Marks tasks done when tests pass
  - Daily Standup Assistant: Provides personalized task status summaries

  - **Kiro Profile**: Added full support for Kiro IDE with automatic installation of 7 Taskmaster agent hooks
  - **Hook-Driven Workflow**: Introduced natural language automation hooks that eliminate manual task status updates
  - **Automatic Hook Installation**: Hooks are now automatically copied to `.kiro/hooks/` when running `task-master rules add kiro`
  - **Language-Agnostic Support**: All hooks support multiple programming languages (JS, Python, Go, Rust, Java, etc.)
  - **Frontmatter Transformation**: Kiro rules use simplified `inclusion: always` format instead of Cursor's complex frontmatter
  - **Special Rule**: Added `taskmaster_hooks_workflow.md` that guides AI assistants to prefer hook-driven completion

  Key hooks included:
  - Task Dependency Auto-Progression: Automatically starts tasks when dependencies complete
  - Code Change Task Tracker: Updates task progress as you save files
  - Test Success Task Completer: Marks tasks done when tests pass
  - Daily Standup Assistant: Provides personalized task status summaries
  - PR Readiness Checker: Validates task completion before creating pull requests
  - Complexity Analyzer: Auto-expands complex tasks into manageable subtasks
  - Git Commit Task Linker: Links commits to tasks for better traceability

  This creates a truly autonomous development workflow where task management happens naturally as you code!

  The `update` command now handles AI responses more robustly. If the AI forgets to include certain task fields, the command will automatically fill in the missing data from your original tasks instead of failing. This means smoother bulk task updates without losing important information like IDs, dependencies, or completed subtasks.

  When using `task-master expand` to break down tasks into subtasks, dependencies between subtasks are now properly validated. Previously, subtasks with dependencies would fail validation. Now subtasks can correctly depend on their siblings within the same parent task.

  - Task Master now creates its instructions in `.taskmaster/CLAUDE.md` instead of overwriting the user's `CLAUDE.md`
  - Adds an import section to the user's CLAUDE.md that references the Task Master instructions
  - Preserves existing user content in CLAUDE.md files
  - Provides clean uninstall that only removes Task Master's additions

  **Breaking Change**: Task Master instructions for Claude Code are now stored in `.taskmaster/CLAUDE.md` and imported into the main CLAUDE.md file. Users who previously had Task Master content directly in their CLAUDE.md will need to run `task-master rules remove claude` followed by `task-master rules add claude` to migrate to the new structure.

- [#840](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master/pull/840) [`b40139c`](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master/commit/b40139ca0517fd76aea4f41d0ed4c10e658a5d2b) Thanks [@Crunchyman-ralph](https://github.com/Crunchyman-ralph)! - Added comprehensive rule profile management:

  **New Profile Support**: Added comprehensive IDE profile support with eight specialized profiles: Claude Code, Cline, Codex, Cursor, Roo, Trae, VS Code, and Windsurf. Each profile is optimized for its respective IDE with appropriate mappings and configuration.
  **Initialization**: You can now specify which rule profiles to include at project initialization using `--rules <profiles>` or `-r <profiles>` (e.g., `task-master init -r cursor,roo`). Only the selected profiles and configuration are included.
  **Add/Remove Commands**: `task-master rules add <profiles>` and `task-master rules remove <profiles>` let you manage specific rule profiles and MCP config after initialization, supporting multiple profiles at once.
  **Interactive Setup**: `task-master rules setup` launches an interactive prompt to select which rule profiles to add to your project. This does **not** re-initialize your project or affect shell aliases; it only manages rules.
  **Selective Removal**: Rules removal intelligently preserves existing non-Task Master rules and files and only removes Task Master-specific rules. Profile directories are only removed when completely empty and all conditions are met (no existing rules, no other files/folders, MCP config completely removed).
  **Safety Features**: Confirmation messages clearly explain that only Task Master-specific rules and MCP configurations will be removed, while preserving existing custom rules and other files.
  **Robust Validation**: Includes comprehensive checks for array types in MCP config processing and error handling throughout the rules management system.

  This enables more flexible, rule-specific project setups with intelligent cleanup that preserves user customizations while safely managing Task Master components.

  Introduces a new provider that enables using Claude models (Opus and Sonnet) through the Claude Code CLI without requiring an API key.

  Key features:
  - New claude-code provider with support for opus and sonnet models
  - No API key required - uses local Claude Code CLI installation
  - Optional dependency - won't affect users who don't need Claude Code
  - Lazy loading ensures the provider only loads when requested
  - Full integration with existing Task Master commands and workflows
  - Comprehensive test coverage for reliability
  - New --claude-code flag for the models command

  Users can now configure Claude Code models with:
  task-master models --set-main sonnet --claude-code
  task-master models --set-research opus --claude-code

  The @anthropic-ai/claude-code package is optional and won't be installed unless explicitly needed.

- [#460](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master/pull/460) [`a09a2d0`](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master/commit/a09a2d0967a10276623e3f3ead3ed577c15ce62f) Thanks [@joedanz](https://github.com/joedanz)! - Added comprehensive rule profile management:

  **New Profile Support**: Added comprehensive IDE profile support with eight specialized profiles: Claude Code, Cline, Codex, Cursor, Roo, Trae, VS Code, and Windsurf. Each profile is optimized for its respective IDE with appropriate mappings and configuration.
  **Initialization**: You can now specify which rule profiles to include at project initialization using `--rules <profiles>` or `-r <profiles>` (e.g., `task-master init -r cursor,roo`). Only the selected profiles and configuration are included.
  **Add/Remove Commands**: `task-master rules add <profiles>` and `task-master rules remove <profiles>` let you manage specific rule profiles and MCP config after initialization, supporting multiple profiles at once.
  **Interactive Setup**: `task-master rules setup` launches an interactive prompt to select which rule profiles to add to your project. This does **not** re-initialize your project or affect shell aliases; it only manages rules.
  **Selective Removal**: Rules removal intelligently preserves existing non-Task Master rules and files and only removes Task Master-specific rules. Profile directories are only removed when completely empty and all conditions are met (no existing rules, no other files/folders, MCP config completely removed).
  **Safety Features**: Confirmation messages clearly explain that only Task Master-specific rules and MCP configurations will be removed, while preserving existing custom rules and other files.
  **Robust Validation**: Includes comprehensive checks for array types in MCP config processing and error handling throughout the rules management system.

  This enables more flexible, rule-specific project setups with intelligent cleanup that preserves user customizations while safely managing Task Master components.

  The new `research` command provides AI-powered research capabilities that automatically gather relevant project context to answer your questions. The command intelligently selects context from multiple sources and supports interactive follow-up questions in CLI mode.

  **Key Features:**
  - **Intelligent Task Discovery**: Automatically finds relevant tasks and subtasks using fuzzy search based on your query keywords, supplementing any explicitly provided task IDs
  - **Multi-Source Context**: Gathers context from tasks, files, project structure, and custom text to provide comprehensive answers
  - **Interactive Follow-ups**: CLI users can ask follow-up questions that build on the conversation history while allowing fresh context discovery for each question
  - **Flexible Detail Levels**: Choose from low (concise), medium (balanced), or high (comprehensive) response detail levels
  - **Token Transparency**: Displays detailed token breakdown showing context size, sources, and estimated costs
  - **Enhanced Display**: Syntax-highlighted code blocks and structured output with clear visual separation

  **Usage Examples:**

  ```bash
  # Basic research with auto-discovered context
  task-master research "How should I implement user authentication?"

  # Research with specific task context
  task-master research "What's the best approach for this?" --id=15,23.2

  # Research with file context and project tree
  task-master research "How does the current auth system work?" --files=src/auth.js,config/auth.json --tree

  # Research with custom context and low detail
  task-master research "Quick implementation steps?" --context="Using JWT tokens" --detail=low
  ```

  **Context Sources:**
  - **Tasks**: Automatically discovers relevant tasks/subtasks via fuzzy search, plus any explicitly specified via `--id`
  - **Files**: Include specific files via `--files` for code-aware responses
  - **Project Tree**: Add `--tree` to include project structure overview
  - **Custom Context**: Provide additional context via `--context` for domain-specific information

  **Interactive Features (CLI only):**
  - Follow-up questions that maintain conversation history
  - Fresh fuzzy search for each follow-up to discover newly relevant tasks
  - Cumulative context building across the conversation
  - Clean visual separation between exchanges
  - **Save to Tasks**: Save entire research conversations (including follow-ups) directly to task or subtask details with timestamps
  - **Clean Menu Interface**: Streamlined inquirer-based menu for follow-up actions without redundant UI elements

  **Save Functionality:**

  The research command now supports saving complete conversation threads to tasks or subtasks:
  - Save research results and follow-up conversations to any task (e.g., "15") or subtask (e.g., "15.2")
  - Automatic timestamping and formatting of conversation history
  - Validation of task/subtask existence before saving
  - Appends to existing task details without overwriting content
  - Supports both CLI interactive mode and MCP programmatic access via `--save-to` flag

  **Enhanced CLI Options:**

  ```bash
  # Auto-save research results to a task
  task-master research "Implementation approach?" --save-to=15

  # Combine auto-save with context gathering
  task-master research "How to optimize this?" --id=23 --save-to=23.1
  ```

  **MCP Integration:**
  - `saveTo` parameter for automatic saving to specified task/subtask ID
  - Structured response format with telemetry data
  - Silent operation mode for programmatic usage
  - Full feature parity with CLI except interactive follow-ups

  The research command integrates with the existing AI service layer and supports all configured AI providers. Both CLI and MCP interfaces provide comprehensive research capabilities with intelligent context gathering and flexible output options.

  Adds the `--append` flag to `update-task` command, enabling it to behave like `update-subtask` with timestamped information appending. This provides more flexible task updating options:

  **CLI Enhancement:**
  - `task-master update-task --id=5 --prompt="New info"` - Full task update (existing behavior)
  - `task-master update-task --id=5 --append --prompt="Progress update"` - Append timestamped info to task details

  **Full MCP Integration:**
  - MCP tool `update_task` now supports `append` parameter
  - Seamless integration with Cursor and other MCP clients
  - Consistent behavior between CLI and MCP interfaces

  Instead of requiring separate subtask creation for progress tracking, you can now append timestamped information directly to parent tasks while preserving the option for comprehensive task updates.

Commands like parse-prd, analyze-complexity, and others now support targeting specific task lists, enabling rapid prototyping and parallel development workflows.

  Key features:
  - parse-prd --tag=feature-name: Parse PRDs into separate task contexts on the fly
  - analyze-complexity --tag=branch: Generate tag-specific complexity reports
  - All task operations can target specific contexts while preserving other lists
  - Non-existent tags are created automatically for seamless workflow

- [#779](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master/pull/779) [`c0b3f43`](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master/commit/c0b3f432a60891550b00acb113dc877bd432995f) Thanks [@eyaltoledano](https://github.com/eyaltoledano)! - Introduces Tagged Lists: AI Multi-Context Task Management System

  This major feature release introduces Tagged Lists, a comprehensive system that transforms Taskmaster into a multi-context task management powerhouse. You can now organize tasks into completely isolated contexts, enabling parallel (agentic) development workflows, team collaboration, and project experimentation without conflicts.

  **🏷️ Tagged Task Lists Architecture:**

  The new tagged system fundamentally improves how tasks are organized:
  - **Legacy Format**: `{ "tasks": [...] }`
  - **New Tagged Format**: `{ "master": { "tasks": [...], "metadata": {...} }, "feature-xyz": { "tasks": [...], "metadata": {...} } }`
  - **Automatic Migration**: Existing projects will seamlessly migrate to tagged format with zero user intervention
  - **State Management**: New `.taskmaster/state.json` tracks current tag, last switched time, migration status and more.
  - **Configuration Integration**: Enhanced `.taskmaster/config.json` with tag-specific settings and defaults.

  By default, your existing task list will be migrated to the `master` tag.

  **🚀 Complete Tag Management Suite:**

  **Core Tag Commands:**
  - `task-master tags [--show-metadata]` - List all tags with task counts, completion stats, and metadata
  - `task-master add-tag <name> [options]` - Create new tag contexts with optional task copying
  - `task-master delete-tag <name> [--yes]` - Delete tags (and attached tasks) with double confirmation protection
  - `task-master use-tag <name>` - Switch contexts and immediately see next available task
  - `task-master rename-tag <old> <new>` - Rename tags with automatic current tag reference updates
  - `task-master copy-tag <source> <target> [options]` - Duplicate tag contexts for experimentation

  **🤖 Full MCP Integration for Tag Management:**

  Task Master's multi-context capabilities are now fully exposed through the MCP server, enabling powerful agentic workflows:
  - **`list_tags`**: List all available tag contexts.
  - **`add_tag`**: Programmatically create new tags.
  - **`delete_tag`**: Remove tag contexts.
  - **`use_tag`**: Switch the agent's active task context.
  - **`rename_tag`**: Rename existing tags.
  - **`copy_tag`**: Duplicate entire task contexts for experimentation.

  **Tag Creation Options:**
  - `--copy-from-current` - Copy tasks from currently active tag
  - `--copy-from=<tag>` - Copy tasks from specific tag
  - `--from-branch` - Creates a new tag using the active git branch name (for `add-tag` only)
  - `--description="<text>"` - Add custom tag descriptions
  - Empty tag creation for fresh contexts

  **🎯 Universal --tag Flag Support:**

  Every task operation now supports tag-specific execution:
  - `task-master list --tag=feature-branch` - View tasks in specific context
  - `task-master add-task --tag=experiment --prompt="..."` - Create tasks in specific tag
  - `task-master parse-prd document.txt --tag=v2-redesign` - Parse PRDs into dedicated contexts
  - `task-master analyze-complexity --tag=performance-work` - Generate tag-specific reports
  - `task-master set-status --tag=hotfix --id=5 --status=done` - Update tasks in specific contexts
  - `task-master expand --tag=research --id=3` - Break down tasks within tag contexts

  This way you or your agent can store out of context tasks into the appropriate tags for later, allowing you to maintain a groomed and scoped master list. Focus on value, not chores.

  **📊 Enhanced Workflow Features:**

  **Smart Context Switching:**
  - `use-tag` command shows immediate next task after switching
  - Automatic tag creation when targeting non-existent tags
  - Current tag persistence across terminal sessions
  - Branch-tag mapping for future Git integration

  **Intelligent File Management:**
  - Tag-specific complexity reports: `task-complexity-report_tagname.json`
  - Master tag uses default filenames: `task-complexity-report.json`
  - Automatic file isolation prevents cross-tag contamination

  **Advanced Confirmation Logic:**
  - Commands only prompt when target tag has existing tasks
  - Empty tags allow immediate operations without confirmation
  - Smart append vs overwrite detection

  **🔄 Seamless Migration & Compatibility:**

  **Zero-Disruption Migration:**
  - Existing `tasks.json` files automatically migrate on first command
  - Master tag receives proper metadata (creation date, description)
  - Migration notice shown once with helpful explanation
  - All existing commands work identically to before

  **State Management:**
  - `.taskmaster/state.json` tracks current tag and migration status
  - Automatic state creation and maintenance
  - Branch-tag mapping foundation for Git integration
  - Migration notice tracking to avoid repeated notifications
  - Grounds for future context additions

  **Backward Compatibility:**

  **🔬 New Research Save-to-File Functionality:**

  Added comprehensive save-to-file capability to the research command, enabling users to preserve research sessions for future reference and documentation.

  **CLI Integration:**
  - New `--save-file` flag for `task-master research` command
  - Consistent with existing `--save` and `--save-to` flags for intuitive usage
  - Interactive "Save to file" option in follow-up questions menu

  **MCP Integration:**
  - New `saveToFile` boolean parameter for the `research` MCP tool
  - Enables programmatic research saving for AI agents and integrated tools

  **File Management:**
  - Automatically creates `.taskmaster/docs/research/` directory structure
  - Generates timestamped, slugified filenames (e.g., `2025-01-13_what-is-typescript.md`)
  - Comprehensive Markdown format with metadata headers including query, timestamp, and context sources
  - Clean conversation history formatting without duplicate information

You can still generate them anytime using the `generate` command.

- [#779](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master/pull/779) [`c0b3f43`](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master/commit/c0b3f432a60891550b00acb113dc877bd432995f) Thanks [@eyaltoledano](https://github.com/eyaltoledano)! - Enhanced get-task/show command to support comma-separated task IDs for efficient batch operations

  **New Features:**
  - **Multiple Task Retrieval**: Pass comma-separated IDs to get/show multiple tasks at once (e.g., `task-master show 1,3,5` or MCP `get_task` with `id: "1,3,5"`)
  - **Smart Display Logic**: Single ID shows detailed view, multiple IDs show compact summary table with interactive options
  - **Batch Action Menu**: Interactive menu for multiple tasks with copy-paste ready commands for common operations (mark as done/in-progress, expand all, view dependencies, etc.)
  - **MCP Array Response**: MCP tool returns structured array of task objects for efficient AI agent context gathering

  **Benefits:**
  - **Faster Context Gathering**: AI agents can collect multiple tasks/subtasks in one call instead of iterating
  - **Improved Workflow**: Interactive batch operations reduce repetitive command execution
  - **Better UX**: Responsive layout adapts to terminal width, maintains consistency with existing UI patterns
  - **API Efficiency**: RESTful array responses in MCP format enable more sophisticated integrations

  This enhancement maintains full backward compatibility while significantly improving efficiency for both human users and AI agents working with multiple tasks.

  - **Fixed moving tasks to become subtasks of empty parents**: When moving a task to become a subtask of a parent that had no existing subtasks (e.g., task 89 → task 98.1), the operation would fail with validation errors.
  - **Fixed moving subtasks between parents**: Subtasks can now be properly moved between different parent tasks, including to parents that previously had no subtasks.
  - **Improved comma-separated batch moves**: Multiple tasks can now be moved simultaneously using comma-separated IDs (e.g., "88,90" → "92,93") with proper error handling and atomic operations.

  These fixes enables proper task hierarchy reorganization for corner cases that were previously broken.

  - `.taskmaster/docs/` - Documentation including PRD files (previously `scripts/`)
  - `.taskmaster/reports/` - Complexity analysis reports (previously `scripts/`)
  - `.taskmaster/templates/` - Template files like example PRD
  - `.taskmaster/config.json` - Configuration (previously `.taskmasterconfig`)

  **Migration & Backward Compatibility:**
  - Existing projects continue to work with legacy file locations
  - New projects use the consolidated structure automatically
  - Run `task-master migrate` to move existing projects to the new structure
  - All CLI commands and MCP tools automatically detect and use appropriate file locations

  **Benefits:**
  - Cleaner project root with Task Master files organized in one location
  - Reduced file scatter across multiple directories
  - Improved project navigation and maintenance
  - Consistent file organization across all Task Master projects

  This change maintains full backward compatibility while providing a migration path to the improved structure.

  - **Interactive Setup Enhancement**: Added "Custom Ollama model" option to `task-master models --setup`, matching the existing OpenRouter functionality
  - **Live Model Validation**: When setting Ollama models, Taskmaster now validates against the local Ollama instance by querying `/api/tags` endpoint
  - **Configurable Endpoints**: Uses the `ollamaBaseUrl` from `.taskmasterconfig` (with role-specific `baseUrl` overrides supported)
  - **Robust Error Handling**:
    - Detects when Ollama server is not running and provides clear error messages
    - Validates model existence and lists available alternatives when model not found
    - Graceful fallback behavior for connection issues
  - **Full Platform Support**: Both MCP server tools and CLI commands support the new validation
  - **Improved User Experience**: Clear feedback during model validation with informative success/error messages

When used, Taskmaster leverages the research model to:
  - Research current technologies and best practices relevant to the project
  - Identify technical challenges and security concerns not explicitly mentioned in the PRD
  - Include specific library recommendations with version numbers
  - Provide more detailed implementation guidance based on industry standards
  - Create more accurate dependency relationships between tasks

  This results in higher quality, more actionable tasks with minimal additional effort.

  _NOTE_ That this is an experimental feature. Research models don't typically do great at structured output. You may find some failures when using research mode, so please share your feedback so we can improve this.

This new command supports moving standalone tasks to become subtasks, subtasks to become standalone tasks, and moving subtasks between different parents. The implementation handles circular dependencies, validation, and proper updating of parent-child relationships.

  **Usage:**
  - CLI command: `task-master move --from=<id> --to=<id>`
  - MCP tool: `move_task` with parameters:
    - `from`: ID of task/subtask to move (e.g., "5" or "5.2")
    - `to`: ID of destination (e.g., "7" or "7.3")
    - `file` (optional): Custom path to tasks.json

  **Example scenarios:**
  - Move task to become subtask: `--from="5" --to="7"`
  - Move subtask to standalone task: `--from="5.2" --to="7"`
  - Move subtask to different parent: `--from="5.2" --to="7.3"`
  - Reorder subtask within same parent: `--from="5.2" --to="5.4"`
  - Move multiple tasks at once: `--from="10,11,12" --to="16,17,18"`
  - Move task to new ID: `--from="5" --to="25"` (creates a new task with ID 25)

  **Multiple Task Support:**
  The command supports moving multiple tasks simultaneously by providing comma-separated lists for both `--from` and `--to` parameters. The number of source and destination IDs must match. This is particularly useful for resolving merge conflicts in task files when multiple team members have created tasks on different branches.

  **Validation Features:**
  - Allows moving tasks to new, non-existent IDs (automatically creates placeholders)
  - Prevents moving to existing task IDs that already contain content (to avoid overwriting)
  - Validates source tasks exist before attempting to move them
  - Ensures proper parent-child relationships are maintained

- [#521](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master/pull/521) [`ed17cb0`](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master/commit/ed17cb0e0a04dedde6c616f68f24f3660f68dd04) Thanks [@Crunchyman-ralph](https://github.com/Crunchyman-ralph)! - .taskmasterconfig now supports a baseUrl field per model role (main, research, fallback), allowing endpoint overrides for any provider.

- [#536](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master/pull/536) [`f4a83ec`](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master/commit/f4a83ec047b057196833e3a9b861d4bceaec805d) Thanks [@Crunchyman-ralph](https://github.com/Crunchyman-ralph)! - Add Ollama as a supported AI provider.
  - You can now add it by running `task-master models --setup` and selecting it.
  - Ollama is a local model provider, so no API key is required.
  - Ollama models are available at `http://localhost:11434/api` by default.
  - You can change the default URL by setting the `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` environment variable or by adding a `baseUrl` property to the `ollama` model role in `.taskmasterconfig`.
    - If you want to use a custom API key, you can set it in the `OLLAMA_API_KEY` environment variable.

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- [#240](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master/pull/240) [`ef782ff`](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master/commit/ef782ff5bd4ceb3ed0dc9ea82087aae5f79ac933) Thanks [@eyaltoledano](https://github.com/eyaltoledano)! - feat(expand): Enhance `expand` and `expand-all` commands
  - Integrate `task-complexity-report.json` to automatically determine the number of subtasks and use tailored prompts for expansion based on prior analysis. You no longer need to try copy-pasting the recommended prompt. If it exists, it will use it for you. You can just run `task-master update --id=[id of task] --research` and it will use that prompt automatically. No extra prompt needed.
  - Change default behavior to _append_ new subtasks to existing ones. Use the `--force` flag to clear existing subtasks before expanding. This is helpful if you need to add more subtasks to a task but you want to do it by the batch from a given prompt. Use force if you want to start fresh with a task's subtasks.

- [#240](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master/pull/240) [`87d97bb`](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master/commit/87d97bba00d84e905756d46ef96b2d5b984e0f38) Thanks [@eyaltoledano](https://github.com/eyaltoledano)! - Adds support for the OpenRouter AI provider. Users can now configure models available through OpenRouter (requiring an `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`) via the `task-master models` command, granting access to a wide range of additional LLMs. - IMPORTANT FYI ABOUT OPENROUTER: Taskmaster relies on AI SDK, which itself relies on tool use. It looks like **free** models sometimes do not include tool use. For example, Gemini 2.5 pro (free) failed via OpenRouter (no tool use) but worked fine on the paid version of the model. Custom model support for Open Router is considered experimental and likely will not be further improved for some time.

- [#240](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master/pull/240) [`1ab836f`](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master/commit/1ab836f191cb8969153593a9a0bd47fc9aa4a831) Thanks [@eyaltoledano](https://github.com/eyaltoledano)! - Adds model management and new configuration file .taskmasterconfig which houses the models used for main, research and fallback. Adds models command and setter flags. Adds a --setup flag with an interactive setup. We should be calling this during init. Shows a table of active and available models when models is called without flags. Includes SWE scores and token costs, which are manually entered into the supported_models.json, the new place where models are defined for support. Config-manager.js is the core module responsible for managing the new config."

  - Adds the `--ollama` and `--openrouter` flags to `task-master models --set-<role>` command to set models for those providers outside of the support models list.
  - Updated `task-master models --setup` interactive mode with options to explicitly enter custom Ollama or OpenRouter model IDs.
  - Implemented live validation against OpenRouter API (`/api/v1/models`) when setting a custom OpenRouter model ID (via flag or setup).
  - Refined logic to prioritize explicit provider flags/choices over internal model list lookups in case of ID conflicts.
  - Added warnings when setting custom/unvalidated models.
  - We obviously don't recommend going with a custom, unproven model. If you do and find performance is good, please let us know so we can add it to the list of supported models.

  - **Update Initialization Dependencies:** Ensure newly initialized projects (`task-master init`) include all required AI SDK dependencies (`@ai-sdk/*`, `ai`, provider wrappers) in their `package.json` for out-of-the-box AI feature compatibility. Remove unnecessary dependencies (e.g., `uuid`) from the init template.
  - **Silence `npm install` during `init`:** Prevent `npm install` output from interfering with non-interactive/MCP initialization by suppressing its stdio in silent mode.
  - **Improve Conditional Model Setup:** Reliably skip interactive `models --setup` during non-interactive `init` runs (e.g., `init -y` or MCP) by checking `isSilentMode()` instead of passing flags.
  - **Refactor `init.js`:** Remove internal `isInteractive` flag logic.
  - **Update `init` Instructions:** Tweak the "Getting Started" text displayed after `init`.
  - **Fix MCP Server Launch:** Update `.cursor/mcp.json` template to use `node ./mcp-server/server.js` instead of `npx task-master-mcp`.
  - **Update Default Model:** Change the default main model in the `.taskmasterconfig` template.

Previously, it only considered top-level tasks, making its recommendation less useful when a parent task containing subtasks was already marked 'in-progress'. - The updated logic now prioritizes finding the next available subtask within any 'in-progress' parent task, considering subtask dependencies and priority. - If no suitable subtask is found within active parent tasks, it falls back to recommending the next eligible top-level task based on the original criteria (status, dependencies, priority).

  This change makes the next command much more relevant and helpful during the implementation phase of complex tasks.

- [#240](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master/pull/240) [`6cb213e`](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master/commit/6cb213ebbd51116ae0688e35b575d09443d17c3b) Thanks [@eyaltoledano](https://github.com/eyaltoledano)! - Adds a 'models' CLI and MCP command to get the current model configuration, available models, and gives the ability to set main/research/fallback models." - In the CLI, `task-master models` shows the current models config. Using the `--setup` flag launches an interactive set up that allows you to easily select the models you want to use for each of the three roles. Use `q` during the interactive setup to cancel the setup. - In the MCP, responses are simplified in RESTful format (instead of the full CLI output). The agent can use the `models` tool with different arguments, including `listAvailableModels` to get available models. Run without arguments, it will return the current configuration. Arguments are available to set the model for each of the three roles. This allows you to manage Taskmaster AI providers and models directly from either the CLI or MCP or both. - Updated the CLI help menu when you run `task-master` to include missing commands and .taskmasterconfig information. - Adds `--research` flag to `add-task` so you can hit up Perplexity right from the add-task flow, rather than having to add a task and then update it.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- [#71](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master/pull/71) [`7141062`](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master/commit/71410629ba187776d92a31ea0729b2ff341b5e38) Thanks [@eyaltoledano](https://github.com/eyaltoledano)! - - **Easier Ways to Use Taskmaster (CLI & MCP):**
  - You can now use Taskmaster either by installing it as a standard command-line tool (`task-master`) or as an MCP server directly within integrated development tools like Cursor (using its built-in features). **This makes Taskmaster accessible regardless of your preferred workflow.**
  - Setting up a new project is simpler in integrated tools, thanks to the new `initialize_project` capability.
  - **Complete MCP Implementation:**
    - NOTE: Many MCP clients charge on a per tool basis. In that regard, the most cost-efficient way to use Taskmaster is through the CLI directly. Otherwise, the MCP offers the smoothest and most recommended user experience.
    - All MCP tools now follow a standardized output format that mimicks RESTful API responses. They are lean JSON responses that are context-efficient. This is a net improvement over the last version which sent the whole CLI output directly, which needlessly wasted tokens.
    - Added a `remove-task` command to permanently delete tasks you no longer need.
    - Many new MCP tools are available for managing tasks (updating details, adding/removing subtasks, generating task files, setting status, finding the next task, breaking down complex tasks, handling dependencies, analyzing complexity, etc.), usable both from the command line and integrated tools. **(See the `taskmaster.mdc` reference guide and improved readme for a full list).**
  - **Better Task Tracking:**
    - Added a "cancelled" status option for tasks, providing more ways to categorize work.
  - **Smoother Experience in Integrated Tools:**
    - Long-running operations (like breaking down tasks or analysis) now run in the background **via an Async Operation Manager** with progress updates, so you know what's happening without waiting and can check status later.
  - **Improved Documentation:**
    - Added a comprehensive reference guide (`taskmaster.mdc`) detailing all commands and tools with examples, usage tips, and troubleshooting info. This is mostly for use by the AI but can be useful for human users as well.
    - Updated the main README with clearer instructions and added a new tutorial/examples guide.
    - Added documentation listing supported integrated tools (like Cursor).
  - **Increased Stability & Reliability:**
    - Using Taskmaster within integrated tools (like Cursor) is now **more stable and the recommended approach.**
    - Added automated testing (CI) to catch issues earlier, leading to a more reliable tool.
    - Fixed release process issues to ensure users get the correct package versions when installing or updating via npm.
  - **Better Command-Line Experience:**
    - Fixed bugs in the `expand-all` command that could cause **NaN errors or JSON formatting issues (especially when using `--research`).**
    - Fixed issues with parameter validation in the `analyze-complexity` command (specifically related to the `threshold` parameter).
    - Made the `add-task` command more consistent by adding standard flags like `--title`, `--description` for manual task creation so you don't have to use `--prompt` and can quickly drop new ideas and stay in your flow.
    - Improved error messages for incorrect commands or flags, making them easier to understand.
    - Added confirmation warnings before permanently deleting tasks (`remove-task`) to prevent mistakes. There's a known bug for deleting multiple tasks with comma-separated values. It'll be fixed next release.
    - Renamed some background tool names used by integrated tools (e.g., `list-tasks` is now `get_tasks`) to be more intuitive if seen in logs or AI interactions.
    - Smoother project start: **Improved the guidance provided to AI assistants immediately after setup** (related to `init` and `parse-prd` steps). This ensures the AI doesn't go on a tangent deciding its own workflow, and follows the exact process outlined in the Taskmaster workflow.
  - **Clearer Error Messages:**
    - When generating subtasks fails, error messages are now clearer, **including specific task IDs and potential suggestions.**
    - AI fallback from Claude to Perplexity now also works the other way around. If Perplexity is down, will switch to Claude.
  - **Simplified Setup & Configuration:**
    - Made it clearer how to configure API keys depending on whether you're using the command-line tool (`.env` file) or an integrated tool (`.cursor/mcp.json` file).
    - Taskmaster is now better at automatically finding your project files, especially in integrated tools, reducing the need for manual path settings.
    - Fixed an issue that could prevent Taskmaster from working correctly immediately after initialization in integrated tools (related to how the MCP server was invoked). This should solve the issue most users were experiencing with the last release (0.10.x)
    - Updated setup templates with clearer examples for API keys.
    - \*\*For advanced users setting up the MCP server manually, the command is now `npx -y task-master-ai task-master-mcp`.
  - **Enhanced Performance & AI:**
    - Updated underlying AI model settings:
      - **Increased Context Window:** Can now handle larger projects/tasks due to an increased Claude context window (64k -> 128k tokens).
      - **Reduced AI randomness:** More consistent and predictable AI outputs (temperature 0.4 -> 0.2).
      - **Updated default AI models:** Uses newer models like `claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219` and Perplexity `sonar-pro` by default.
      - **More granular breakdown:** Increased the default number of subtasks generated by `expand` to 5 (from 4).
      - **Consistent defaults:** Set the default priority for new tasks consistently to "medium".
    - Improved performance when viewing task details in integrated tools by sending less redundant data.
  - **Documentation Clarity:**
    - Clarified in documentation that Markdown files (`.md`) can be used for Product Requirements Documents (`parse_prd`).
    - Improved the description for the `numTasks` option in `parse_prd` for better guidance.
  - **Improved Visuals (CLI):**
    - Enhanced the look and feel of progress bars and status updates in the command line.
    - Added a helpful color-coded progress bar to the task details view (`show` command) to visualize subtask completion.
    - Made progress bars show a breakdown of task statuses (e.g., how many are pending vs. done).
    - Made status counts clearer with text labels next to icons.
    - Prevented progress bars from messing up the display on smaller terminal windows.
    - Adjusted how progress is calculated for 'deferred' and 'cancelled' tasks in the progress bar, while still showing their distinct status visually.
  - **Fixes for Integrated Tools:**
    - Fixed how progress updates are sent to integrated tools, ensuring they display correctly.
    - Fixed internal issues that could cause errors or invalid JSON responses when using Taskmaster with integrated tools.
