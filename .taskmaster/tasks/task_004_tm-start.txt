# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement claude-code executor
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Add functionality to execute the claude-code command with the built prompt
# Details:
Implement the functionality to execute the claude command with the built prompt. This should use Node.js child_process.exec() to run the command directly in the terminal.

```typescript
import { exec } from 'child_process';

// Inside execute method, after task validation
private async executeClaude(prompt: string): Promise<void> {
  console.log('Starting claude-code to implement the task...');
  
  try {
    // Execute claude with the prompt
    const claudeCommand = `claude "${prompt.replace(/"/g, '\\"')}"`;
    
    // Use execSync to wait for the command to complete
    const { execSync } = require('child_process');
    execSync(claudeCommand, { stdio: 'inherit' });
    
    console.log('Claude session completed.');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error executing claude-code:', error.message);
    process.exit(1);
  }
}
```

Then call this method from the execute method after building the prompt.

# Test Strategy:
Test by running the command with a valid task ID and verifying that the claude command is executed with the correct prompt. Check that the command handles errors appropriately if claude-code is not available.
