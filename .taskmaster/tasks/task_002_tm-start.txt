# Task ID: 2
# Title: Register start command in CLI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Register the start command in the CLI application
# Details:
Update the CLI application to register the new start command. This involves importing the StartCommand class and adding it to the commands array in the CLI initialization.

In `apps/cli/src/index.ts` or the appropriate file where commands are registered:

```typescript
import { StartCommand } from './commands/start.command';

// Add StartCommand to the commands array
const commands = [
  // ... existing commands
  new StartCommand(),
];

// Register all commands
commands.forEach(command => command.register(program));
```

# Test Strategy:
Verify the command is correctly registered by running the CLI with --help and checking that the start command appears in the list of available commands.
