			"taskId": 118,
			"taskTitle": "Create AI Provider Base Architecture",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the conversion of base-provider.js to TypeScript BaseProvider class: 1) Convert to TypeScript and define IAIProvider interface, 2) Implement abstract class with core properties, 3) Define abstract methods and Template Method pattern, 4) Add retry logic with exponential backoff, 5) Implement validation and logging. Focus on maintaining compatibility with existing provider pattern while adding type safety.",
			"reasoning": "The codebase already has a well-established BaseAIProvider class in JavaScript. Converting to TypeScript mainly involves adding type definitions and ensuring the existing pattern is preserved. The complexity is moderate because the pattern is already proven in the codebase."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 119,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Provider Factory with Dynamic Imports",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create ProviderFactory implementation: 1) Set up class structure and types, 2) Implement provider selection switch statement, 3) Add dynamic imports for tree-shaking, 4) Handle provider instantiation with config, 5) Add comprehensive error handling. The existing PROVIDERS registry pattern should guide the implementation.",
			"reasoning": "The codebase already uses a dual registry pattern (static PROVIDERS and dynamic ProviderRegistry). Creating a factory is straightforward as the provider registration patterns are well-established. Dynamic imports are already used in the codebase."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 120,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Anthropic Provider",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement AnthropicProvider following existing patterns: 1) Create class structure with imports, 2) Implement constructor and client initialization, 3) Add generateCompletion with Claude API integration, 4) Implement token calculation and utility methods, 5) Add error handling and exports. Use the existing anthropic.js provider as reference.",
			"reasoning": "AnthropicProvider already exists in the codebase with full implementation. This task essentially involves adapting the existing implementation to match the new TypeScript architecture, making it relatively straightforward."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 121,
			"taskTitle": "Create Prompt Builder and Task Parser",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Build prompt system and parser: 1) Create PromptBuilder with template methods, 2) Implement TaskParser with dependency injection, 3) Add parsePRD core logic with file reading, 4) Implement task enrichment and metadata, 5) Add comprehensive error handling. Leverage the existing prompt management system in src/prompts/.",
			"reasoning": "While the codebase has a sophisticated prompt management system, creating a new PromptBuilder and TaskParser requires understanding the existing prompt templates, JSON schema validation, and integration with the AI provider system. The task involves significant new code."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 122,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Configuration Management",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create ConfigManager with validation: 1) Define Zod schema for IConfiguration, 2) Implement constructor with defaults, 3) Add validate method with error handling, 4) Create type-safe get method with generics, 5) Implement getAll and finalize exports. Reference existing config-manager.js for patterns.",
			"reasoning": "The codebase has an existing config-manager.js with sophisticated configuration handling. Adding Zod validation and TypeScript generics adds complexity, but the existing patterns provide a solid foundation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 123,
			"taskTitle": "Create Utility Functions and Error Handling",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement utilities and error handling: 1) Create ID generation module with unique formats, 2) Build TaskMasterError base class, 3) Add error sanitization for security, 4) Implement development-only logging, 5) Create specialized error subclasses. Keep implementation simple and focused.",
			"reasoning": "This is a straightforward utility implementation task. The codebase already has error handling patterns, and ID generation is a simple algorithmic task. The main work is creating clean, reusable utilities."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 124,
			"taskTitle": "Implement TaskMasterCore Facade",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create main facade class: 1) Set up TaskMasterCore structure with imports, 2) Implement lazy initialization logic, 3) Add parsePRD coordination method, 4) Implement getTasks and other facade methods, 5) Create factory function and exports. This ties together all other components into a cohesive API.",
			"reasoning": "This is the most complex task as it requires understanding and integrating all other components. The facade must coordinate between configuration, providers, storage, and parsing while maintaining a clean API. It's the architectural keystone of the system."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 125,
			"taskTitle": "Create Placeholder Providers and Complete Testing",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement testing infrastructure: 1) Create OpenAIProvider placeholder, 2) Create GoogleProvider placeholder, 3) Build MockProvider for testing, 4) Write TaskParser unit tests, 5) Create integration tests for parse-prd flow. Follow the existing test patterns in tests/ directory.",
			"reasoning": "While creating placeholder providers is simple, the testing infrastructure requires understanding Jest with ES modules, mocking patterns, and comprehensive test coverage. The existing test structure provides good examples to follow."
